# hello-world environment variables
# Env vars are loaded from the root .env first, then this file (overrides).
# Only add workflow-specific vars here. Shared vars like OPENAI_API_KEY
# are already defined in the root .env.example.

# No workflow-specific overrides needed for hello-world.
# To override a shared var for this workflow only, uncomment and set it here:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-a-different-key-for-this-workflow
